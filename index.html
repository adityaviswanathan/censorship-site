			<p class="detail-text">The Golden Shield Project, or more  commonly as the Great Firewall of China, is a vast censorship and surveillance program developed and operated by the Ministry of Public Security of the Chinese government. The Internet arrived in 1994, and in 1997 the Ministry took initial steps to regulate the Internet, by stipulating that users were forbidden to  using the Internet to “harm national security...incite resistance to the...laws...promote the overthrow of the government or socialist system...provide sexually suggestive material or encourage gambling, violence, or murder”, among other things. In 1998, work on the firewall commenced. The first part finished in 2006 and the second part finished in 2008. The Great Firewall not only censors certain websites, but also limits connections to the international work, by monitoring online activity both within and outside of China [1]. For example, social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are banned, as well as other sites that allow users from around the world to exchange ideas. </p>

Due to the microblog revolution, this has resulted in a major crackdown for well-known bloggers, who are subject to arrests and persecution. The Chinese government has deemed these blogging sites as a “bad influence on society”. </li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">Online mobilizations by Chinese citizens continue; citizens have found ways to circumvent the firewall through proxies and other technologies. However, the Great Firewall of China persists and citizens must resort to evading the government in order to communicate freely.</li>

			<div class="well">One of the main reasons that make some countries restrict internet, cyberspace activities, and access to online information is existing examples of successful revolutions that knocked governments down using cyberspace. These individual countries that fear losing power over their society prefer to restrict their nations from information access than to lose control over the countries they rule. The Arab Spring has been a great example to demonstrate the essential role of internet in successful revolutions. Hence, information access and internet serve as threats to dictatorial countries.</div>

			<div class="col-md-8">
				<ul class="list-group">
				  <li class="list-group-item">Facebook played an important role in Egypt revolution which was successful and knocked the corrupted government down. Wael Ghanim, a 29-year-old Google marketing executive who played a great role in the revolution, was one day browsing the internet when he found a picture of bloodied and disfigured face, its jaw broken, a young life taken away, the life of  Khaled Mohamed who had been beaten to death by the Egyptian police. Soon, Khaled started a Facebook page named “We are all Khaled Said”, in just a few weeks, the page had 130,000 fans. </li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">Internet became a method for Egyptians to share their frustration and anger on the government and soon the frustration online turned to silent protests on the streets. The internet spreaded the words faster among the people and the online media covered more about Egyptians dissatisfaction on the government. Egyptian activists used Facebook to organize demonstrations the ‘Youth Movement’ advertised the protests, news of which also blew through Twitter and over mobile phones via SMS. As the outage continued, the costs increased. The protests on the streets and the high online activity "cost Egypt tens of millions of dollars per day for lost e-business,". It was not too long after when millions of people gathered on the streets to protest against the corrupted government and ask for a democratic country.</li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">It is very clear that Egypt is one of the cases that provide an answer for why some individual countries restrict information access and internet. The dictatorial governments of these countries know that if they allow information access and internet they will put their powers into danger. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, and blogs have made sharing information very fast and simple that is why most of them are blocked in North Korea because these platforms give the society a lot of power to share information in a short period of time.</li>

			<br />
			<div class="col-md-8">
				<ul class="list-group">
				  <li class="list-group-item">Just like Egypt, the internet has played a great role in spreading the revolution in Bahrain. The whole revolution started via a Facebook page named “Feb 14th” the day on which all the country was urged to protest in streets asking for a democratic government. More people became bloggers, more people held cameras to document and spread information online, and more people tweeted. The government could only restrict internet access to the internet to calm the protesters and attack the revolutions. However, the Bahraini citizens did not surrender and many started their outside connections to spread the news during protesting times. </li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">Though the revolution has not yet reached its goals it was successful to send its message to the world, all through the internet. The country during the rising revolution was in a very unstable condition and had to ask for support from Saudi Arabia to control the rising anger and frustration within society. Bahrain example urges the dictatorial countries to continue restricting access to information online. If it had not been for the internet the Bahraini society would have faced a more difficult time to spread the word and demonstrate its dissatisfaction about the dictatorial government. </li>

				  <li class="list-group-item">In relation to the incident mentioned above, Makerbot, the leading producer of 3D printers, removed designs that posed a threat of violence under their guideline that their products are to “empower the creative process and make things for good”.</li>
				  <li class="list-group-item">As technologies like the 3D printer become popular and previously specialized tasks like construction become standardized, legislature will have to be developed to establish guidelines for what can and can’t be created or procured with these tools. Since a single piece of legislature is unlikely to be able to address all future developments that test the barriers of what should and should not be done, it is advisable for government to consciously develop an elastic framework to deal with technology-legal affairs, particularly regarding national security. </li>
